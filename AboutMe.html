        <p class="gump">Hello, my name is Yusuf Khan and Iâ€™m a student at Clovis High School and CART in Clovis. I enjoy music, video games, and movies. My favorite musical genres are rap, rock, and electric. My favorite musical artists are Logic, J. Cole, and Jon Bellion. I like most music except country, but I can listen to close to anything. I think that music is one of the coolest things we can make. I enjoy these artists the best because they are lyrically gifted and have really good beats. I like listening to music while working I feel that it helps me work and it is a good way to make working for large quantities of time very fun.I also enjoy learning to code at CART it really lets me learn a lot more about computers and a different understanding of computers and websites. This has let me see how hard websites are to make when you see a website on your phone it takes a lot of code for the website to fit in theirs. When I was making a website a CART with a group it took us very long to make a website, but we worked very well together to make a good website. My group and I took a while to make it, but when we were done we had a great looking website. I like working with groups or by myself and can work well with deadlines and groups. I feel that working with groups is better because it lets you bounce ideas off each other. Thank you for reading and considering me. I also like video games because it lets you work well with other people and it is overall fun. You have to be smart, have good aim, and work well with teammates to do well in that games.
